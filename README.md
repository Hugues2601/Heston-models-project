This project aims at The aim of this project is to analyze the models in the Heston family: the Heston model, the Bates model and the double Heston model.
I created a Streamlit application to price calls and puts using the Heston models. In the application, it is also possible to enter a volatility surface in Excel format in order to calibrate the Heston models.
Finally, you can play the role of a market maker, calculating Bid and Ask for vanilla options, binary options and volatility swaps. (The spread is calculated here as the difference between the max and min of the three models calibrated on the chosen volatility surface).
